#### the index of the tab to scan. The 1st tab is 0, 2nd is 1... Default is the first tab in stash.

#### is it a quad tab? Probably.

#### Set the main filter you usually use for POE 
#### This is still under development, so if you want to use this feature, make a copy of the provided filter and edit it to your preferences
#### Then copy it to your My Games\\Path of Exile directory where all your other filters are
filter=POEQOL_Base.filter

#### Specify how you want the items from each slot to show up in your filter. These get dynamically inserted/removed from your main filter specified above
chaos_items_filter=chaos_items_filter.filter

#### Quad tab with the scroll organization template (google it :) can neatly fit 16 sets. After accumulating this number of items, that item slot taken off filter (Underdevelopment)
threshold=16

#### Maximum number of sets to highlight at once. Inventory can only fit 2 complete sets, so I only show two at a time and prefer click again to highlight the next set after vendoring.
highlight_max_num_sets=2

#### ignore threshold for certain item slots. Usually Rings, Amulets, and Belts are limiting, so they are always show. Options are: BodyArmours,Helmets,OneHandWeapons,Gloves,Boots,Amulets,Belts,Rings
ignore_threshold=Rings,Amulets,Belts

#### Run POE in full-screen windowed on monitor 1 and input that monitors resolution below
#screen_res=3440x1440

#### refresh_time(below): How often, in seconds, you expect the public stash to be updated. 
#### After this period of time, the app re-downloads the stash info from the official site. 
#### I think 30s is reasonable since that is about how long it would take to vendor an entire tab. 
#### You can use values like 5-15s for debugging, but don't expect it to actually have updated in that time, you'll get a pop-up that says there's not enough items if you cycle through all the sets and try to start the cycle again before this amount of time.
#### But, if the website stash hasn't updated, it will highlight the same areas as before even after this amount of time.
#### Pushing the "Remove Highlights" should manually pull from the site and restart the cycle
refresh_time=30
